        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM. The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a
            multiple of 5, and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including
            bank charges). For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US. Calculate Pooja's account balance
            after an attempted transaction.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Input">
        <h2>Input Format</h2>
        <p>Positive integer 0 < X <=2000 - the amount of cash which Pooja wishes to withdraw.<br>

                Nonnegative number 0<= Y <=2000 with two digits of precision - Pooja's initial account balance.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Output">
        <h2>Output</h2>
        <pre>
            Output the account balance after the attempted transaction, given as a number with two digits of 
            precision. If there is not enough money in the account to complete the transaction, output the 
            current bank balance.
